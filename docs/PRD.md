# Project Requirements Document (PRD)

## Introduction
The AI Data Categorization System is designed to automatically categorize various types of data using machine learning models. The system provides a robust infrastructure for data processing, model training, and deployment, with comprehensive monitoring and feedback mechanisms.

## Features

### Core Features
- Automatic data categorization
- Support for multiple data formats (text, CSV, JSON)
- Real-time predictions
- Model version control
- Performance monitoring

### API Features
- RESTful API endpoints
- JWT authentication
- Rate limiting
- Feedback collection

### Monitoring Features
- Real-time performance metrics
- System health monitoring
- Automated alerts

## Architecture Overview

### Data Flow
1. Data Input → Validation → Preprocessing → Feature Engineering → Model Prediction → Result Categorization
2. Feedback Collection → Model Retraining → Model Versioning → Performance Monitoring

### Key Components
- **Data Ingestion Layer**: Handles raw data input
- **Processing Layer**: Cleans and processes data
- **Model Layer**: Makes predictions and handles retraining
- **API Layer**: Provides RESTful endpoints
- **Monitoring Layer**: Tracks system and model performance

## Technical Requirements

### Infrastructure
- Python 3.8+
- Docker and Kubernetes
- Redis and PostgreSQL
- Prometheus and Grafana

### Development Environment
- Git version control
- Automated testing
- CI/CD pipeline
- Containerized deployment

### Monitoring and Observability
- Model performance metrics
- System health checks
- Alerting system

## Development Process

### Version Control
- Git-based workflow
- Feature branch strategy
- Code reviews

### Testing
- Unit tests
- Integration tests
- Performance tests

### CI/CD Pipeline
- Automated builds and tests
- Container image creation
- Deployment to staging and production

### Monitoring

## Deployment Strategy

### Environments
1. **Development**: Local development environment
2. **Staging**: Pre-production environment
3. **Production**: Live environment with auto-scaling

### Deployment Process
1. Code changes → Automated tests → Container build → Staging deployment → Production deployment
2. Monitoring → Alerting → Rollback if necessary

### Monitoring and Maintenance
- Continuous performance tracking
- Regular system health checks
- Automated scaling based on load
